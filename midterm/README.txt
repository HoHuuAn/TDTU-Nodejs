# Overview
This is our midterm project of WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT USING NODEJS about Web RTC. 
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables real-time communication between web browsers or applications. It allows for peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing without the need for additional plugins or software installations.

For our midterm project, which focuses on web application development using Node.js and WebRTC, we worked on implementing a web application that incorporates WebRTC functionality. The project includes the following components:
1. Source Code: This refers to the actual codebase of our web application. It includes the necessary instructions, functions, and logic to implement the desired WebRTC features. The source code will likely be written in JavaScript, utilizing the Node.js platform and various libraries and frameworks.
2. PDF File: The PDF file is a report that encompasses research knowledge about WebRTC. It may cover various aspects of WebRTC, such as its core components, practical applications, advantages, and disadvantages. The report could also include information on related technologies and frameworks used in conjunction with WebRTC, like Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, and Socket.IO.
